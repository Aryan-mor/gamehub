rules:
  - For any new or modified action handler, you must write an E2E test before implementing or modifying the handler logic in index.ts.
  - The E2E test file must be named `e2e.test.ts` and placed in the same directory as the handler.
  - Focus tests on inline button `callback_data` and navigation flow; only assert message text when absolutely necessary.
  - A change is incomplete if the corresponding E2E test is missing or did not fail before implementation.
