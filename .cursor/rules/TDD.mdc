# 🧠 Telegram Bot Debugging Workflow

## 🎯 Core Principle
Run and debug the Telegram bot **inside this Cursor session**. We will fix issues together in real-time.

## 🔒 Rules

- **DO NOT** open a new external terminal.
- **DO NOT** run the bot as a background or detached process.
- **DO NOT** stop automatically after one run or error.
- Run and **persist the bot session inline** in this conversation.

## ⚙️ Behavior

- Start the bot in this session and **show logs inline**:
  - User input
  - Callback queries
  - Game state changes
  - Errors
- Keep the session **alive** for full debugging.
- If an error occurs:
  - Pause and display the error
  - Ask for confirmation before restarting

## 🔧 Developer Commands

- `🔁 restart bot` — manually restart the bot
- `❌ stop bot` — stop everything

## 📦 Additional Instructions

- Log all key events using the logger (start, result, failure)
- All user interactions (clicks, guesses, choices) must appear in logs
- Do not auto-restart or stop unless explicitly requested
- Games should log every step: coin choice → game start → result

## 🧪 Testing Expectations

- For every bug found, write a test that fails first (TDD)
- All core functionality (games, coins, sessions) must be tested
- Use mocks for Telegram API where needed
- Avoid regressions by improving test coverage when fixing issues

## 💬 Session Flow

- The bot stays online during this session
- I will interact with it through Telegram and share logs here
- Fixes will be handled step-by-step inside this thread
