# Bot Debugging Workflow Rules

## Core Principle
Run the Telegram bot directly inside this Cursor conversation — not in an external terminal.

## 🔒 Strict Rules
- **DO NOT** open a new external terminal
- **DO NOT** run the bot in background or separate process
- **DO NOT** auto-stop after one run
- **DO NOT** auto-reload unless explicitly requested
- Run the bot right here, in this chat — log everything inline

## 🧠 Expected Behavior
- Start the bot and keep it running inside the conversation
- Show full logs here: function start/end, user input, callback data, errors
- If the bot crashes or throws any error:
  → Pause the execution
  → Read and show the error
  → Ask user before restarting

## 📋 User Commands
User will manually say:
- `🔁 restart bot` — to restart the bot
- `❌ stop bot` — to stop everything

## 🎯 Objective
Debug the bot **together** inside this session.
Keep it running until **no errors are shown** and all game flows work correctly.

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Do not exit the run loop until user explicitly says so
- Do not auto-reload unless user requests it
- Always show logs and debug information inline
- Work together to fix issues in real-time

## 🔧 Technical Approach
Since direct inline execution isn't possible:
1. Run bot in terminal but keep it visible
2. Show logs when user shares them
3. Analyze and fix issues together
4. Iterate until everything works perfectly
5. Keep bot running until user says "❌ stop bot"
