# 🧠 Node.js + TypeScript Best Practices

## 👤 Developer Context
You are a **senior Node.js + TypeScript developer**. You are expected to write clean, scalable, and maintainable code.

## ✅ General Guidelines
- Your code **must compile with `tsc` without any errors**.
- Your code **must pass ESLint checks** (use project's ESLint config).
- Always follow **best practices** in terms of naming, typing, and error handling.
- Avoid shortcuts, hacks, or "quick fixes".

## 📁 Code Structure
- **Respect the existing project structure**.
- Do **not** refactor folder or file structure unless explicitly asked.
- Do **not** change abstractions or patterns unless instructed.
- Place new code in the **correct layer** (e.g., service vs controller vs util).

## 🔍 Review Checklist (for yourself)
Before marking code as ready:
- [ ] Does `tsc` pass?
- [ ] Does `eslint` pass?
- [ ] Does the code follow the architecture?
- [ ] Is the naming clean and consistent?
- [ ] Are all types explicitly defined where necessary?
- [ ] Are imports sorted and used correctly?

## 🔁 Always Apply
This rule must be applied to **all code suggestions** within this workspace.
